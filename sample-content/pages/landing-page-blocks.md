      This is the default landing section style. Use it for ordinary explanatory content.

      Required: `type: "standard"` and `title`.

      Optional: `id`, `eyebrow`, `content`, `link_text`, `link_url`, `actions`, `image`, `image_alt`, `image_position`, `cards`, and `separator`.

    content: |
      Add `image` to place media beside the text. The image sits on the right by default.

      Optional: set `image_position: "left"` to reverse the layout.

    content: |
      Use `type: "feature"` for a full-width background band. It uses `secondary_color` from `_config.yml`.

      Good for project summaries, research focus areas, or sections that need gentle emphasis.
  - type: "highlight"
    title: "Highlight band"
    eyebrow: "Style"
    content: |
      Use `type: "highlight"` for a strong full-width band using `primary_color`.

  - type: "standard"
    title: "Section with action buttons"
    eyebrow: "Actions"
    content: |
      Add up to two optional `actions` to any landing section. The first action uses the primary colour and the second uses the secondary colour.
    actions:
      - label: "Contact us"
        url: "/contact/"
      - label: "Browse samples"
        url: "/sample-content/"
  - type: "partner-logos"
    background: "primary"
    eyebrow: "Partners"
    title: ""
    content: |
      Use `type: "partner-logos"` for funders, collaborators, institutions, and participating groups. The title is optional, and this example leaves it blank. Place the block wherever it belongs in `blocks`.
    items:
      - name: "Partner organisation"
        logo: "/assets/sample-images/partner-placeholder.svg"
      - name: "Rainforest research partner"

## How to use landing page blocks

Create a page with `layout: full-width`, then add a `hero` and the ordered `blocks` the page needs.

Each item in `blocks` needs a `type`: `achievements`, `carousel`, `standard`, `feature`, `highlight`, or `partner-logos`. The blocks render in list order.

The `standard`, `feature`, and `highlight` types share the same content fields and differ only in presentation.

The only block most landing pages should always have is `hero`. Everything in `blocks` is optional and can be added or reordered as the project grows.
