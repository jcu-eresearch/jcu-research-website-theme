landing_sections:
  - id: "standard-section"
    title: "Standard text section"
    eyebrow: "Default"
    content: |
      This is the default `landing_sections` style. Use it for ordinary explanatory content.

      Required: `title`.

      Optional: `id`, `eyebrow`, `content`, `link_text`, `link_url`, `image`, `image_alt`, `image_position`, `cards`, `style`, and `separator`.
    link_text: "Example text link"

    eyebrow: "Media"
    image: "/assets/sample-images/card-research-context.svg"
    image_alt: "Abstract research context image"
    content: |
      Add `image` to place media beside the text. The image sits on the right by default.

      Optional: set `image_position: "left"` to reverse the layout.
  - title: "Image on the left"
    eyebrow: "Media"
    image_position: "left"
    image: "/assets/sample-images/card-project-setting.svg"
    image_alt: "Abstract project setting image"
    content: |
      This section uses `image_position: "left"`. The layout stacks cleanly on small screens.
  - title: "Feature band"
    eyebrow: "Style"
    style: "feature"
    image: "/assets/sample-images/card-tree-kangaroo.svg"
    image_alt: "Abstract feature image"
    content: |
      Use `style: "feature"` for a full-width pale background band. It uses `secondary_background_color` and `secondary_background_opacity` from `_config.yml`.

      Good for project summaries, research focus areas, or sections that need gentle emphasis.
  - title: "Highlight band"
    eyebrow: "Style"
    style: "highlight"
    content: |
      Use `style: "highlight"` for a strong full-width band using `primary_color`.

      Good for impacts, calls to action, key findings, or short statements that should stand apart.
    link_text: "Optional link"
    link_url: "#"
  - title: "Card grid section"
    eyebrow: "Cards"

        url: "#"
      - title: "Partner activity"
        text: "Keep card text short so the landing page remains easy to scan."
        link_text: "View activity"
        url: "#"
contact_cta:
  eyebrow: "Contact CTA"
  title: "Contact call to action"
  content: |
    Use `contact_cta` near the end of the page to give visitors a clear next step. `eyebrow`, `content`, `link_text`, `link_url`, and `separator` are optional, but the block works best with a link.
  link_text: "Contact us"
  link_url: "/contact/"
partner_organisations:
  eyebrow: "Partners"
  title: "Partner organisations block"
  content: |
    Use `partner_organisations` for funders, collaborators, institutions, and participating groups. This block is always displayed last when present.

## How to use landing page blocks

Create a page with `layout: landing`, then add the front matter groups you need. You can omit whole groups if a landing page does not need them.

The main groups are `hero`, `achievements`, `carousel`, `landing_sections`, `contact_cta`, and `partner_organisations`.

The only group most landing pages should always have is `hero`. Everything else is optional and can be added as the project grows.
